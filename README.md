# Skills look up APP

- General architecture - TypeScript, React (hooks and functional components), Redux (state management), Styled Components, webpack for building and developemnt
- Changed a bit Pagination component logic, since did not catch how it works from the Design mockup (there are only next buttons available)
- In order to start Application you should have Node and Yarn installed then launch following commands: `yarn install`, `yarn build`, `yarn start` - open http://localhost:3000/
